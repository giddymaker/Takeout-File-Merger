# Takeout-File-Merger
This is a simple python script to merge Google Takeout directories and files.

I got really frustrated when I wanted to put my data somewhere other than google and also to spend less money on that cloud storage. I hoped it would be as easy as downloading the directory in GDrive I wanted home and it would zip up nicely, I could unpack it, and be done with it. Google, being the abusive side of the relationship, made it difficult AF to get my goddamn data in the the same organizational format that I gave it to them so they could be good custodians and stewards of that data. Instead they used my data in unethical ways and threated me with torture to have my data in an organized manner. Instead I had 75 - 2GB .zip files. Within was a truly sociopathic array of directory duplicates containing fractions of the files contained within the original directory of the duplicated name. Of course, if you're reading this, you probably know this problem very well since it has been around for several years.

Maybe you also are aware of takeout.google.com. This had a 50GB option for "Exports larger than this size will be split into multiple files.
"

I used it incorrectly and had a lot of files to merge. Then I used this to merge them. Maybe one day if I feel compelled I'll make it also unzip the files, and maybe if I'm feeling some type of way I'll see if it can do the export and/or download for me. But that is not my expertise (webby stuff) so IDK.

K thx. hope you enjoy. byeeeee
